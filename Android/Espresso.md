# Android: Espresso

- Espresso for Android is a lightweight, fast, and customizable Android testing framework, designed to provide concise and reliable automated UI tests.
- Conditional logic in test automation is a bad practice because the same test can be executed in different ways, which eliminates easy ways of bug reproduction, reduces the trust in the tests, and increases the test maintenance effort.
- Tests should be written in a simple and plain way, so everyone who looks at them will understand what step led to the issue.
