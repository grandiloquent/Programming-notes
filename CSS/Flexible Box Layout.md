# CSS: Flexible Box Layout

### align-content

The CSS align-content property sets how the browser distributes space between and around content items along the cross-axis of a flexbox container, and the main-axis of a grid container.

### align-items

The CSS align-items property sets the align-self value on all direct children as a group. The align-self property sets the alignment of an item within its containing block. In Flexbox it controls the alignment of items on the Cross Axis, in Grid Layout it controls the alignment of items on the Block Axis within their grid area.

### align-self

The align-self CSS property aligns flex items of the current flex line overriding the align-items value. If any of the item's cross-axis margin is set to auto, then align-self is ignored. In Grid layout align-self aligns the item inside the grid area.

### flex

The flex CSS property sets how a flex item will grow or shrink to fit the space available in its flex container. It is a shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis.

### flex-basis

The flex-basis CSS property sets the initial main size of a flex item. It sets the size of the content box unless otherwise set with box-sizing.

### flex-direction

The flex-direction CSS property sets how flex items are placed in the flex container defining the main axis and the direction (normal or reversed).

### flex-flow

The flex-flow CSS property is a shorthand property for flex-direction and flex-wrap properties.

### flex-grow

The flex-grow CSS property sets how much of the available space in the flex container should be assigned to that item (the flex grow factor). If all sibling items have the same flex grow factor, then all items will receive the same share of available space, otherwise it is distributed according to the ratio defined by the different flex grow factors.

In use, flex-grow is used alongside the other flex properties flex-shrink and flex-basis, and normally defined using the flex shorthand to ensure all values are set.

### flex-shrink

The flex-shrink CSS property sets the flex shrink factor of a flex item. If the size of flex items is larger than the flex container, items shrink to fit according to flex-shrink.

### flex-wrap

The flex-wrap CSS property sets whether flex items are forced onto one line or can wrap onto multiple lines. If wrapping is allowed, it sets the direction that lines are stacked.

### justify-content

The CSS justify-content property defines how the browser distributes space between and around content items along the main-axis of a flex container, and the inline axis of a grid container.

The interactive example below demonstrates some of the values using Grid Layout.

### min-height

Themin-height CSS property sets the minimum height of an element. It prevents the used value of the height property from becoming smaller than the value specified for min-height.

### min-width

The min-width CSS property sets the minimum width of an element. It prevents the used value of the width property from becoming smaller than the value specified for min-width.

### order

The order CSS property sets the order to lay out an item in a flex or grid container. Items in a container are sorted by ascending order value and then by their source code order.
